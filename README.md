# A Decision Support System for bank telemarketing Campaign Managers


## Summary
This repository implements an integrated Decision Support and Classification System for bank telemarketing campaign managers, built on the UCI Bank Marketing dataset. It provides data ingestion, exploration, model training and maintenance, API endpoints to collect new data and using service's applications, and a user-friendly interface—enabling marketing managers to predict customer subscription to term deposits, streamline campaign strategies, and reduce wasted effort.

This project offers a complete pipeline—from raw data preprocessing to model deployment—to assist marketing managers in making data-driven decisions for telemarketing campaigns based on phone calls. The system uses classification algorithms to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (variable y) and presents results in an interactive dashboard.

## Features
* Data Ingestion & Cleaning

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Model Training & Evaluation

* Knowledge Extraction

* Decision Support Dashboard

* Automated Reporting
Exports periodic performance reports (CSV/PDF) summarizing model outcomes and key insights.

## Dataset
The system uses the “Bank Marketing” dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, containing 41,188 instances and 20 features (e.g., age, job, marital, balance, contact) collected between May 2008 and November 2010. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe (“yes”/“no”) to a term deposit.
